## 💁‍♀️About
👋Hi! This is my first NextJS project as well as my first project using webscraping

## 🤔What it does
It is a very simple little app where you can type in a package name from npm and it will tell you how many downloads it has. Other than that I had fun playing around with routes to add an about page as well as some fun css background animations.

## 🚀Deployment
