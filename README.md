## 💁‍♀️About

👋Hi! This is my first NextJS project as well as my first project using webscraping

## 🤔What it does

It is a very simple little app where you can type in a year (2011-2022)as well as a book genre and it will tell you the most popular book (on [npmjs](https://npmjs.com/ "Opens in new tab")). Other than that I had fun playing around with routes to add an about page as well as some fun css animations.

## 🚀Deployment

You can find the deployed version over at vercel:
[Here](https://package-downloads-webscraper.vercel.app/ "Opens in new tab")

## 🏃‍♀️Run it locally

```
npm run dev
```
